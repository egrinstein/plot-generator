## IMDB plot generation

Django server that uses around 4200 plot summaries from IMDB to generate new pseudorandom (yet somewhat acceptable) plots.

You can see it working [here](http://egrinstein.github.io/plot-generator/)


Some examples of plots generated:

`Armed with a licence to kill, Secret Agent James Bond sets out on his first mission as 007 and must defeat a 
weapons dealer in a high stakes game of poker at Casino Royale, but things become complicated when his teacher has the same agenda.`

`The pressures of fame have superstar singer Noni on the edge to stop an avaricious
oil mogul from taking down one of their men is murdered on a set film.`

`In a violent , futuristic city where the police have the authority to act as judge, jury and executioner, 
a cop is forced to work with his ex-wife to find a hidden Earth ship before an enemy alien species does in order to rescue a failing satellite ,
he insists that his equally old teammates accompany him into space.`
